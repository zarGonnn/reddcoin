Setup
---------------------
[Reddcoin Core](http://reddcoin.com) is the original Reddcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Reddcoin transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once. If you would like the process to go faster you can [download the blockchain directly](bootstrap.md).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Reddcoin on your native platform. 

### Unix

You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run Reddcoin-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:

	sudo apt-get install libqtgui4

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/reddcoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit) or bin/32/reddcoind (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/reddcoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit) or bin/64/reddcoind (headless, 64-bit)



### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run reddcoin-qt.exe.

### OSX

Drag Reddcoin-Qt to your applications folder, and then run Reddcoin-Qt.
